TODO: What is this?

A Few Minor Warnings
--------------------

#. I'm only a second year university student, and software
   isn't even my major; I'm working towards an Electrical and Computer
   Engineering degree, so not only do I have limited time to keep this
   maintained, but I also probably won't write the best code ever.
#. This is a very early release, things might break, and the code is honestly a
   little childish at best. In other words: It'll hopefully get better, but it
   might be a little limited right now.
#. This project follows the semantic versioning specs. All Minor and
   patch versions will not break the major versions API, however an bump of the
   major version signifies that backwards compatibility will most likely be
   broken.
